# Ask A Scientist MediaCloud

This is the code used to query the MediaCloud database for media coverage to be compared to questions data for the Ask A Scientist project.

The Ask a Scientist project was a collaboration between the Federation of American Scientists and the National Science Policy Network during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020.

Volunteer scientists across the globe took questions from the public regarding COVID-19 and researched the answers, which were posted to the project's website.

To improve science communication efforts, we compared the questions we recieved with concurrent media coverage.
Keywords were selected based on the content coding system created by the project team to categorize the questions recieved by the team during the project. We hope this research will identify topic areas that had the most uncertainty for the general public.
